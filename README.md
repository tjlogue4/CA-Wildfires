2020 California Wildfires
===================================

I recently came across [Brian Blaylock's](https://github.com/blaylockbk) tutorial on [plotting fires](https://github.com/blaylockbk/pyBKB_v3/blob/master/BB_GOES/mapping_GOES16_FireTemperature.ipynb) captured on [NOAA GEOS-16/17](https://www.goes.noaa.gov/). I was able to use this to create a [gif](https://github.com/tjlogue4/CA-Wildfires/blob/main/ca_fires.gif) of all the fires that occurred in CA during the year 2020.



## File Description:
* [2020 CA Fires.ipynb](https://github.com/tjlogue4/CA-Wildfires/blob/main/2020%20CA%20Fires.ipynb) Notebook detailing the process to download, plot, and create a gif of the satellite imagery.
* [fires.py](https://github.com/tjlogue4/CA-Wildfires/blob/main/fires.py) Python file used for multiprocessing to speed up image file creation.
* [ca_fires.gif](https://github.com/tjlogue4/CA-Wildfires/blob/main/ca_fires.gif) Final result.
